## A DL tip per day!

Insipred by [jstips](http://www.jstips.co), I decide to build something similar for the Deep Learning community. DLTips are shorts and useful daily tips on popular Deep Learning frameworks that will help you to improve your skills.

What is a tip? A tip is a short reading (less than 2mn) and can be on anything: conventions, hacks, interview questions, how to do something better, how to you organize your workspace, etc.

On a daily basis (or at most), a tip will be posted and tweeted.

Stay tuned to learn about all the items that the future of this awesome field of Deep Learning will holds for us.
